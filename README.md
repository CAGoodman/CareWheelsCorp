Greater Independence through Interdependence

The CareBank integrates IoT and Mobile Tech to support independent living at home in community.
</p>

We passionately believe that technology coupled with social insight will allow people to thrive with utmost independence in their own homes and communities. To bring this to reality, CareWheels has developed the CareBank: a cloud and mobile sensing platform that allows peer groups to monitor each other’s well-being and get credit for their efforts. The CareBank App integrates peer-to-peer TeleCare assessment with automatic TimeBank micro-credit into a simple user interface. We put the power of peer care in the palm of your hand.

The CareBank platform consists of a mobile app, sensor system and server that provide TeleCare and 
online TimeBank services. The CareBank integrates peer-to-peer TeleCare assessment with TimeBank micro-credit. 
Our key innovation is the integration of several recommendations of the President’s Council of Advisors on 
Science and Technology on Independence, Technology, and Connection in Older Age. The CareBank integrates 
TeleCare remote sensor monitoring and TimeBanking to convert our surplus human capital into shared social capital, 
empowering people to live interdependently, take better care of each other, and uphold the social determinants of health.

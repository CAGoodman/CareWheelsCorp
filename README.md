# Official CareWheels Corporation Repository  

The CareBank platform consists of a mobile app, sensor system and server that provide TeleCare and 
online TimeBank services. The CareBank integrates peer-to-peer TeleCare assessment with TimeBank micro-credit. 
Our key innovation is the integration of several recommendations of the Presidentâ€™s Council of Advisors on 
Science and Technology on Independence, Technology, and Connection in Older Age. The CareBank integrates 
TeleCare remote sensor monitoring and TimeBanking to convert our surplus human capital into shared social capital, 
empowering people to live interdependently, take better care of each other, and uphold the social determinants of health.

Two Intel Encore Fellows have been recruited to take the MVP to a Alpha releasble level  
A new repository CareWheelsCorp is being created to house the new changes
